# Claros V2 Delivery Status

- **As of:** 2026-09-04
- **Branch:** `codex/claros-v2-nerdy`
- **Baseline:** `5fb217715e4b3278f21a882b2652d928f2cca628`
- **Current phase:** Gate 4 ready — Gate 3 is passed; semantic work is not yet integrated
- **Gate state:** Gates 0–3 passed; Windows Docker Desktop remains optional
- **Gate 0 content checkpoint:** `0c15404b87edbbe19b03de93d81ad95aa1e897fd`
- **Gate 1 content checkpoint:** `59cbc509650cc4a65b139a7db23012ead74efb3c`
- **Gate 2 content checkpoint:** `0723303ef718bb28594d519da31ec0a55226fa45`
- **Gate 3 accepted runtime checkpoint:** `2afcdbb92fce3b1d055bc4bf3e4efbaec60c3ce7`

## Current milestone

- **Milestone:** Gate 3 passed at accepted runtime checkpoint `2afcdbb`.
- **Changed:** Added the FastAPI `/api/v2` service, signed anonymous ownership,
  filesystem/GCS adapters, generation-CAS manifests, generated browser types,
  deterministic physical IR and placement, immutable-source inline/appendix
  export, gold corpus, real typed browser integration, and deployment assets.
- **Verified:** Node 22 CI and browser suites passed; 392 tracked Gate-3-only
  backend tests passed at 92-percent branch coverage; audits, strict OpenSpec,
  Terraform validation, authority hashes, Chrome/pikepdf/Acrobat reopening,
  Ubuntu production-container restart, Cloud Build, and live GCS/Cloud Run
  revision replacement all passed.
- **Remote evidence:** GitHub run `33938914646` retained privacy-safe logs and
  both synthetic PDFs. Cloud Build `8bcf24be-5be9-4e81-a8e5-fc2947d39754`
  produced digest `sha256:b4058b7bb22210a82690db7859354dad4fdf354441d57ee46a79deea6d7d5b66`;
  revision `claros-00075-xtv` serves it at 100 percent after live persistence,
  ownership-isolation, and proxy-identity checks.
- **Next action:** Begin Gate 4 only from the frozen physical-IR, candidate,
  placement, and API contracts. Keep the untracked semantic/Realtime draft
  trees excluded until their respective gate work is deliberately started.

## Gate 0 checklist

- [x] Use `codex/claros-v2-nerdy` from exact commit `5fb2177`.
- [x] Copy all three V2 authorities to the repository root byte-for-byte.
- [x] Verify all three SHA-256 values.
- [x] Read all three authorities in full and apply their authority order.
- [x] Preserve prior audit findings; record only the V2-invalidated delta.
- [x] Create `docs/v2/BASELINE_AUDIT.md`.
- [x] Create `docs/v2/CONFLICTS.md`.
- [x] Create `docs/v2/DECISIONS.md`, including dependencies and ownership.
- [x] Create `docs/v2/RISKS.md`.
- [x] Create `docs/v2/STATUS.md`.
- [x] Rewrite the active OpenSpec capabilities and task graph in place.
- [x] Preserve the V1 17/19 history as disposition, not V2 progress.
- [x] Run and record `openspec validate claros-reconstruction --strict`.
- [x] Run and record post-synthesis baseline regression checks.
- [x] Run and record `npm audit --audit-level=high`.
- [x] Verify current screenshot evidence still exists.
- [x] Inspect dependency and production-source diffs; both are unchanged.
- [x] Run and record `git diff --check`.
- [x] Complete an independent read-only authority/OpenSpec contract review with
  no blocking contradiction found.
- [x] Commit the Gate 0 planning-only checkpoint.

## Prior baseline evidence

The following passed on the unmodified baseline before the V2 authority delta:

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Pass |
| `npm test` | Pass — 7 tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Pass — 4 Playwright tests |
| `npm run build-storybook` | Pass |
| Pre-V2 `openspec validate claros-reconstruction --strict` | Pass |

The existing browser evidence is in `test-results/`: landing desktop/mobile,
workspace desktop, and mobile worksheet/answer states. It is retained only as
the V1 baseline. Gate 2 produces the full V2 matrix under
`artifacts/v2/screenshots/`.

## Fresh Gate 0 verification — 2026-09-04

| Command/evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` | Exit 0; 357 packages installed; install audit reported 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm run ci` | Exit 0; production build passed and 7/7 Vitest tests passed |
| `npm run build-storybook` | Exit 0; static Storybook build completed |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Exit 0; 4/4 Chromium Playwright tests passed |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | Exit 0; 0 vulnerabilities |
| `openspec validate claros-reconstruction --strict` | Exit 0; change valid |
| Authority SHA-256 checks | All three exact expected hashes matched |
| `Get-ChildItem -Recurse .\test-results -Filter *.png` | Existing V1 browser screenshots present |
| Production/dependency diff | Empty for `package.json`, lockfile, `src`, and `server` |
| Authored-file `git diff --check` | Exit 0; no whitespace errors |
| Independent read-only contract review | No blocking authority, governance, or OpenSpec contradiction found |

The verbatim authority imports contain ten intentional Markdown hard-break
lines with trailing double spaces. `git show --check 0c15404` reports those
lines. They are preserved because changing them would violate the required
byte-for-byte hashes; all authored Gate 0 files pass the whitespace check.

## Fresh Gate 1 verification — 2026-09-04

All commands in this table used Node `v22.23.2` where Node was involved.

| Command/evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` | Exit 0; clean install of 763 packages; install audit reported 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm run ci` | Exit 0; format, lint, typecheck, dependency/license contract, 27/27 Vitest tests, Storybook build, Storybook axe, production build, and bundle closure passed |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Exit 0; 7/7 Chromium tests passed against fresh development and production servers |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | Exit 0; 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm run check:dependencies` | Verified 17 exact versions/licenses, seven approved Untitled primitives, Node 22 engine, and retained legacy dependencies |
| `npm run check:bundles` | Verified four marketing entry chunks exclude PDF/Realtime and all lazy boundaries exist |
| Authentic document evidence | `renderPageRect` crop and full EmbedPDF viewer rendered the checked-in PDF through byte Range requests |
| Accessibility/keyboard evidence | Seven V2 Storybook states passed axe; upload and modal flows passed keyboard, focus restoration, 44px target, and mobile-overflow assertions |
| CSP/WASM/worker evidence | Built app loaded PDFium WASM and worker under production CSP; `/` made no PDF/Realtime request |
| `openspec validate claros-reconstruction --strict` | Exit 0; change valid |
| Authority SHA-256 checks | All three exact expected hashes still match |
| `git diff --check` | Exit 0; no whitespace errors |
| Independent read-only Gate 1 review | Approved with no critical/blocking finding; vendor-upgrade risk retained in `RISKS.md` |

The production and Storybook builds report two accepted pinned-EmbedPDF
warnings: browser externalization of a package `crypto` import and large lazy
viewer chunks. Real crop/full-view execution passes in Chromium under the
production CSP, and the marketing static closure contains neither stack. Gate 6
must repeat this proof before cutover.

## Fresh Gate 2 verification — 2026-09-04

All Node commands in this table used Node `v22.23.2`. Browser evidence and the
visual scorecard are bound to content checkpoint
`0723303ef718bb28594d519da31ec0a55226fa45`.

| Command/evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run ci` | Exit 0; format, lint, typecheck, dependency/license contract, 63/63 Vitest tests, Storybook build, all-story axe, production build, and bundle closure passed |
| Storybook browser sweep | 36/36 V2 stories rendered; zero automated accessibility violations |
| `playwright test` | Exit 0; 22/22 serialized Chromium tests passed against fresh Vite/API servers in 3.1 minutes |
| Direct and guided workflows | Exact review remained mandatory; casual voice agreement could not confirm; typed fallback, captions, interruption, rephrase selection, revision, and reconfirmation passed |
| Partial export and recovery | Export became available after one confirmed answer; unanswered questions remained blank; failure retry and authenticated fixture download passed |
| Authentic document evidence | Question-bound Q1/Q2/Q3 EmbedPDF crops, completed-copy preview, byte-Range source, decoded mobile full viewer, and source-preservation copy passed |
| Responsive/accessibility evidence | Task-first DOM order, 1440x1000/1024x1366/390x844 layouts, keyboard-only completion, focus restoration, 200-percent-equivalent reflow, reduced motion, no overflow, and principal-route axe passed |
| `node scripts/verify-gate2-screenshots.mjs` | Verified 36 exact captures, dimensions, SHA-256 values, checkpoint SHA, and zero external requests |
| Lead and independent visual score | 95/100; every authority-rubric category at least 90 percent; zero critical accessibility defects and zero anti-reference violations |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | Exit 0; 0 vulnerabilities |
| `openspec validate claros-reconstruction --strict` | Exit 0; change valid |
| Authority SHA-256 checks | All three exact expected hashes still match |
| `git diff --check` | Exit 0; no authored whitespace errors |

The first expanded Playwright replay exposed five test-harness defects: lazy
cold-start timing, two ambiguous text locators, an assertion applied to the
guided path instead of only direct typing, and a DOM-order check made before the
workspace mounted. Each was corrected without weakening product assertions;
the focused five-test replay and the subsequent complete 22-test replay passed.
The final visual review is recorded in
`artifacts/v2/gate2-visual-scorecard.md`.

## Fresh Gate 3 verification — 2026-09-04

The complete record is in `artifacts/v2/gate3/verification.md` and is bound to
accepted runtime checkpoint `2afcdbb92fce3b1d055bc4bf3e4efbaec60c3ce7`.

| Command/evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run ci` under Node `v22.22.0` | Exit 0; format, lint, typecheck, dependency/license contract, OpenAPI drift, 73/73 Vitest tests, Storybook build and axe sweep, production build, and bundle closure passed |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Exit 0; 22/22 fixture Chromium flows passed |
| `npm run test:e2e:gate3` | Exit 0; the real FastAPI typed/partial-export flow survived a service restart |
| Gate-3-only pytest | 392 tracked tests passed with 92-percent branch coverage; 23 third-party deprecation warnings |
| Focused reviewer replay | 90 API/storage/PDF/security tests passed; all critical code findings were fixed |
| Ruff format/lint | All tracked Python sources formatted correctly and lint-clean |
| Dependency audits | `npm audit --audit-level=high` reported 0 vulnerabilities; `pip-audit -r requirements-server.txt` found none |
| Terraform | Format, lockfile-readonly initialization, and validation passed with Terraform 1.15.2 and Google provider 7.46.0 |
| Document corpus | Twelve checksum-pinned categories plus all required negative classes passed determinism, exact-text, placement, and failure-code checks |
| Manual PDF reopening | The same SHA-bound inline/appendix export opened correctly in Chrome and Adobe Acrobat 64-bit with source content intact and no appendix truncation |
| Authority/OpenSpec/whitespace | Authority hashes matched; strict OpenSpec and diff checks passed |
| Production container | GitHub Ubuntu run `33938914646` passed for head `2afcdbb`; artifact `9961138256` retains both privacy-checked logs and parser-reopened inline/appendix PDFs |
| Remote source build | Cloud Build `8bcf24be-5be9-4e81-a8e5-fc2947d39754` built the clean committed archive and published immutable digest `sha256:b4058b7b…d5b66` |
| Live GCS/Cloud Run replacement | Revisions `claros-00074-kxl` → `claros-00075-xtv` passed live GCS persistence, ownership isolation, forged-proxy identity, inline/appendix export, and parser reopen |
| Deployed privacy | 69 Cloud Logging entries scanned with zero worksheet, answer, cookie/token, or credential canary matches |

The implementation reserves 30 seconds beneath the 300-second Cloud Run
request ceiling, bounds GCS RPCs and retries, persists owner-recoverable
analysis failures, and lets unsafe higher-priority placement candidates fall
through deterministically to lower-priority classes. These fixes were included
before the checkpoint and exercised through both remote acceptance paths.

## Gate 0 evidence commands

Run from the repository root in PowerShell and retain the complete output:

```powershell
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\CLAROS_V2_SOL_ULTRA_EXECUTION_PRD.md
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\CLAROS_V2_PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\CLAROS_V2_DESIGN.md
npm ci
npm run ci
npm run build-storybook
npm run test:e2e
npm audit --audit-level=high
openspec validate claros-reconstruction --strict
Get-ChildItem -Recurse .\test-results -Filter *.png
git diff -- package.json package-lock.json src server
git status --short -- package.json package-lock.json src server
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Expected authority hashes are listed in `BASELINE_AUDIT.md`. The dependency and
production-source diff must be empty for Gate 0. Any HIGH/CRITICAL runtime
finding or unavailable npm audit keeps Gate 1 blocked.

## Delivery gates

| Gate | Deliverable | Blocking evidence | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Authorities, synthesis, in-place OpenSpec, dependency/ownership plan | Hashes, baseline regressions, npm audit, strict OpenSpec, clean production diff, planning commit | Passed at `0c15404` |
| 1 | Untitled foundation, V2 routes/providers, scoped legacy, authentic EmbedPDF spike, MSW | Build/tests, route and keyboard smoke, CSP/WASM/worker proof, no PDF request from `/` | Passed at `59cbc50` |
| 2 | Fixture-complete V2 UI and fake Realtime | Unit/component/Storybook/Playwright/axe, keyboard/focus/zoom/motion, full screenshot matrix, visual score ≥90 | Passed at `0723303` — 95/100 |
| 3 | FastAPI, GCS adapters, physical IR, placement/export, gold corpus | Python/API/PDF integration, deterministic IR, exact Unicode, immutable source, container/revision smoke | Passed at `2afcdbb` |
| 4 | Responses semantic mapping and rephrase | Recorded/live corpus evaluation, zero invalid IDs, exact reconstruction, safe failure and provenance | Not started |
| 5 | Realtime direct and guided paths | Fake browser suite and manual live voice/recovery/security evidence | Not started |
| 6 | Cutover, hardening, deployment | Full accumulated CI/security/a11y/visual/performance/staging evidence | Not started |
| 7 | Repeatable demo and release bundle | Clean-browser replay, final PDF, deployed smoke, honest submission copy, complete `artifacts/v2` | Not started |

## Gate command contract

Gate 1 adds stable scripts for frontend format, lint, typecheck, unit,
Storybook/browser, build, E2E, accessibility, visual, and API-drift checks.
Gate 3 adds Ruff, pytest contract/PDF/integration coverage, pip-audit, corpus,
container, and `/health` smoke commands. Each later gate reruns every applicable
earlier command against one recorded commit SHA. Manual Chrome/Adobe Reader,
keyboard, live voice, visual, and deployment checks are retained as signed
checklist evidence rather than represented as automation.

## Fixed defaults

- P0 document limits: 10 MiB, 1–8 pages, at most 40 questions.
- Export answer floor: 10pt; fit begins at 12pt.
- Anonymous assignment TTL: 24 hours absolute.
- Review token TTL: 10 minutes, single-mutation with idempotent exact replay.
- P0 processing: bounded synchronous analysis/export with reload-safe status.
- Source delivery: same-origin, authorized, Range-capable proxy.
- Production: one stateless FastAPI/Vite Cloud Run service plus private GCS.
- Health endpoint: `/health`.
- Realtime default: `gpt-realtime-2.1`; semantic default is selected by the
  Gate 4 corpus benchmark.
- P0 restoration: owning browser session only; cross-device/shareable resume
  remains P1.

## Gate 0 exit statement

Gate 0 passed after every checklist item produced objective evidence and the
planning-only checkpoint changed no dependency, production-source, generated
UI, or runtime file. `DECISIONS.md` freezes the Gate 1 interfaces and
`RISKS.md` supplies its stop conditions.

## Gate 1 exit statement

Gate 1 passed at content checkpoint
`59cbc509650cc4a65b139a7db23012ead74efb3c`. The Node 22 clean-install evidence,
full automated checks, real PDF browser evidence, dependency/license audit, and
independent review have no blocking finding. The only retained concerns are
explicit upgrade/cutover risks in `RISKS.md`; they do not weaken any Gate 1
acceptance invariant.

## Gate 2 exit statement

Gate 2 passed at content checkpoint
`0723303ef718bb28594d519da31ec0a55226fa45`. The fixture-complete workflow,
authentic source and completed-copy views, responsive matrix, full automated
checks, and independent 95/100 review have no blocking finding. This checkpoint
does not claim durable assignment truth, dynamic PDF placement/export, a live
semantic model, or live WebRTC; those boundaries remain blocked behind Gates
3–5 exactly as required.

## Gate 3 exit statement

Gate 3 passed at accepted runtime checkpoint
`2afcdbb92fce3b1d055bc4bf3e4efbaec60c3ce7`. Local contract, storage,
document, browser, security, corpus, audit, and manual PDF evidence passed. The
head-associated Ubuntu workflow tested the immutable pull-request merge
revision containing that checkpoint, built and restarted the production
container, and retained privacy-checked logs plus reopened PDFs. The
owner-authorized Cloud Run deployment then proved GCS persistence across
revision replacement, cross-owner denial, managed-proxy identity behavior,
exact digest use, and live browser export/reopen. Windows Docker Desktop is
optional and was not used as acceptance evidence. Tasks 3.8 and 3.9 are
complete; later gates remain unimplemented and must preserve the frozen Gate 3
contracts.
