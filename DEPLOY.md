# Deploy Claros to Google Cloud Run

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- Docker (optional; you can use Cloud Build)

## Build and push image

```bash
# Set your project and region
export PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export REGION=us-central1
export IMAGE=claros-backend
export TAG=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Build with Cloud Build (no local Docker needed)
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${IMAGE}:${TAG}

# Or with Artifact Registry
gcloud artifacts repositories create claros --repository-format=docker --location=${REGION} 2>/dev/null || true
gcloud builds submit --tag ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/claros/${IMAGE}:latest
```

## Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
gcloud run deploy claros \
  --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${IMAGE}:${TAG} \
  --platform managed \
  --region ${REGION} \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key,GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket,GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID},GEMINI_TEXT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash" \
  --min-instances 1 \
  --timeout 3600
```

- **min-instances=1** avoids cold starts during demo.
- **timeout=3600** keeps WebSocket connections alive (Cloud Run default is 60s).
- Create a GCS bucket and grant the Cloud Run service account Storage Object Admin (or equivalent) on that bucket.

**Environment variables:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` are required; `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is required for GCS. `GEMINI_TEXT_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`) is optional and used for answer-writing.

## Frontend

- `/` serves `frontend/landing.html` (marketing page)
- `/app` serves `frontend/app.html` (worksheet + voice UI)
- `/healthz` returns a dependency-free container health response
- Shared tokens live in `frontend/styles/tokens.css`

Session credentials returned to the browser are short-lived opaque values. New server-side session records store only a keyed hash of the session secret; legacy records with a plaintext secret remain readable for compatibility and should be rotated by normal session expiry.

No config change needed: when users open the Cloud Run URL, the frontend uses the same host for API calls.

> Legacy monolithic frontend prototypes were removed after runtime, test, build, and deployment references were audited. The active pages are `frontend/landing.html` and `frontend/app.html`.
